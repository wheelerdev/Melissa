                <p>October is Adopt-a-dog month, an annual focus on finding forever-homes for shelter and rescue
                    animals.
                    Each re-homed dog makes space for more homeless pets at shelters. Sadly, an estimated 3 to 4 million
                    animals are euthanized because of overcrowding in animal shelters every year.
                </p><br>
                <p>The benefits of owning a pet are numerous, but first they need to survive transitioning from the
                    shelter
                    to family life. Make it a smooth transition by welcoming your dog to home with these six tips:
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 1: PREPARE THE HOUSE</h4>
                <p> Before leaving the shelter with the new dog, make sure your home is set up with spaces for them to
                    eat,
                    drink, and sleep. Also, find out what food they use at the shelter. It takes a few days to
                    transition a
                    dog to new food without gastronomical pain.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 2: DOG-PROOF EVERYTHING</h4>
                <p>Take a walk around your home and yard, looking for problem spots. Make sure all food items are out of
                    reach; tuck away stray cords; remove valuable objects or furniture that won’t survive nervous
                    chewing or
                    pet training.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 3: CONSIDER A CRATE</h4>
                <p>While it might seem like a cage to us, many dogs prefer using a crate because of their natural
                    instinct
                    to sleep in caves. Crates can help nervous dogs feel secure in their own space as they adjust to
                    this
                    big change. However, dogs should not be left in their crates all day. They need exercise, play, and
                    entertainment, too.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 4: PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE CHANGE</h4>
                <p>Know that when a new dog first settles into a new home, it takes time for them to adjust and feel
                    secure. Don’t panic when they seem nervous and shy. It can take either days or weeks for a new pet
                    to
                    recognize your home as their home. While they adjust, your role is to build trust and provide a
                    calm,
                    safe place.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 5: ESTABLISH ROUTINES</h4>
                <p>While transitioning to a new home is hard, your new dog will appreciate established routines of
                    walking,
                    eating, and sleeping. It will reassure them of stability and help them adjust faster. So plan when
                    and
                    how much to feed them. Look at your schedule and plan for daily walks. They will thank you.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 6: INTRODUCE OTHER PETS SLOWLY</h4>
                <p>If you have other dogs at home, keep them all on leashes and introduce them outside of the home
                    before
                    bringing a new dog inside. Once they have said “hi” outside, you can move them inside. Keep your new
                    dog
                    on his leash and walk through the house. Let him get used to his new home in a space away from other
                    pets for the first couple days. Then slowly let them interact inside more often until they recognize
                    each other as part of the same pack.

            <h1 class="highlight-purple">May Day Basket Ideas</h1>
            <p>May Day is just a couple weeks away and my inner-child’s heart still skips a beat when I think about
                sharing May Day baskets.
            </p><br>
            <p>My cousin Suzanne and I grew up running around (often barefoot) the little woods behind my home in
                Washington State. My Grandma Cleaver lived through the woods and a cow pasture away. We adored her and
                her stories about growing up in Kansas. One spring, she told us about picking flowers and sneakily
                delivering them to her neighbors on May Day.
            </p><br>
            <p> For two little girls, that idea sounded like the best thing ever. We began making our own baskets from
                construction paper. Sometimes we filled them with daisies, buttercups and dandelions. Other times we
                made flowers out of tissue or colored paper.
            </p><br>
            <p>When the baskets were filled to the brim with flowers, Suzanne and I would sneak up to our neighbors
                homes, hang the handmade baskets on their door knobs, knock and run away.
            </p><br>
            <p>My heart still warms to think about it, even though it has been a long time. I think I will do it again
                this year – but with my little boys. They could not care less about making flowers and baskets, but they
                love to be sneaky. They also love to put a smile on a friends face.
            </p><br>
            <p>I’ve been scouring pinterest for different May Day ideas and wanted to share a few of my favorites:

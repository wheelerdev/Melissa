            <h1 class="highlight-purple">Tips for Photographing Toddlers</h1>
            <p>Having problems getting toddlers to sit still and pose for a picture? Of course you are – they are
                toddlers. Don’t beat yourself up over it, because it is normal for them to run all over the place and
                look at the camera only to turn right as you click. From trial and error, I’ve gathered a few tricks
                that work for me. Read on for the goods.
            </p><br>
            <p>These are pictures from a session with my nephew, who is a typically toddler. I’ve found the best way to
                capture portraits at this stage is to 1.) control what they wear, 2.) control the background 3. ) Don’t
                control them.
            </p><br>
            <p> All three steps work together, but the keys is to let them be themselves. That includes letting them
                walk away from you, playing with rocks, or smiling at Daddy. By controlling their environment, rather
                than them, when they do give a sparkling grin or dimple up, you will be ready.
            </p><br>
            <h4>The Outfit:</h4>
            <p>Talk with mom and dad before hand about what the child will be wearing. If you will be photographing the
                family as well as the toddler, talk about how they can coordinate their outfits. For the session with my
                nephew, I new we would be shooting at an urban location with brick and ironwork backgrounds so I
                suggested a theme of red and black to my sister. Other times, the family has already had plans for
                outfits. Either way, it helps everyone be on the same page.
            </p><br>
            <h4>The Background:</h4>
            <p>Pick a wide, clean background with minimal distractions. It could be a park, a flower garden, the beach
                or anywhere else that allows you focus more on capturing the child than worry about trashcan or parked
                car behind them. In these photos, I knew there would be plenty of brick buildings to use as my clean
                background. I also planned on going during a time of day when there would be less people out and about.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Don't Control Them:</h4>
            <p>And my last tip – plan on taking a lot of pictures to get what you need. Toddlers move a lot and they
                move fast – as I’m sure you know if you have any children. I’ve done a few shoots thinking I had nothing
                only to find that I was able to capture that mischievous glint before the child ran off, or the shy
                smile before it disappeared. This age is so precious and there are many fun expressions. Enjoy it!
